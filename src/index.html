    <p>Welcome! Welcome to City 17.</p>
    <p>You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.</p>
    <p>I thought so much of City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here;</p>
    <p>in the Citadel so thoughtfully provided by, our benefactors.</p>
    <p>I've been proud to call City 17 my home. And so,</p>
    <p>whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts unknown:</p>
    <p>Welcome, to City 17.</p>
    <p>It's safer here.</p>
